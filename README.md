## Technologies Used: 
For styling components `Chakra UI` library was used. 

## Why Next.js
Due to `cors` issues with source API https://api.meteo.lt/v1/ project from Vite React was migrated to Next.js
Backend part was covered in collaboration with RamÅ«nas Musteikis.

## TODO
- Use skeleton for table loading (DONE)
- Add suport for query params in url (use place code)
